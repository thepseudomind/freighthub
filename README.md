# Business need

The main goal is for the user to check the shipments at a glance. This allows users to take faster decisions and plan ahead of time.

Providing information to the customer increases transparency and reduces communication issues.

# Features

- The user shall be able to:
  - See shipments in pages of 20 elements per page
  - Search by shipment id
  - Sort by different fields (e.g. id, name) in ascending/descending order
  - View the shipment information on a separate shipment details page
  - Update the shipment name (should persist when the page is reloaded)

The interactions should not refresh the page.


### Extra features

- An additional page to show history of shipments by the user in session (i assumed the user has an ID of U1000)


Things omitted
----

- Mobile responsiveness and testing, this is due to the fact i didn't quite have enough time to do this out of busy schedule as i was tasked to do this challenge but i wanted to get something across as soon as possible.
